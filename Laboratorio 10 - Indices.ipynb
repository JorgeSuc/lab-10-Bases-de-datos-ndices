I should have returned the vehicle and waited until they surrendered my keys to my car, but not knowing better, I stuck with the car feeling that the interest rate was already too high - and the payment, too. It was 17 % or so, but the real shoe dropped the following week : the dealership Fed exed to my work a change in the interest rate to 25 %. Since I could n&#x27;t return the vehicle and was living on XXXX income and no child support as a single parent, I had to sign it. I was utterly alone because even those who were telling me to return the car were powerless to help me. I ended up paying for the car, and through a series of personal misfortunes, lost that job and the car ended up failing. Turns out the car was a time bomb : the engine was a design requiring the timing belt is changed before a certain mileage and it snapped breaking irreparably. The car was repossessed in XXXX. With a sticker price of {$13000.00} or so, the GM financial company claimed I still owed them just over {$6000.00}. They sold the car at auction for {$1000.00}, somehow I ended up owing them {$7500.00} even though they claimed that the amount was deducted from the loan! The truth was I &#x27;d had to give them numerous late payments and deferments- with a late payment of {$120.00} a pop and numerous other &quot; fees &#x27;&#x27; including rude and ruthless &quot;&quot; customer service &#x27;&#x27; people</td>\n",

       "        <td>On XXXX XXXX I received a letter dated XXXX XXXX from Discover card. They said I had 10 days from the date on the letter to respond. They had determined that despite the evidence that the company was acting in bad faith and had in fact not supplied me with anything usable for my vehicle, they would return the complete amount to them. I asked for a supervisor, who told me the same thing. She was in Delaware. I called back and asked to speak with a supervisor again. This time she was in XXXX XXXX XXXX. She confirmed the same thing. In fact, she gave me an example. She said that if I ordered a couch, got it home and did n&#x27;t like it, I &#x27;d have to pay for the return costs. I explained that was not the case here. I was shipped a defective &#x27;package &#x27; that the seller wanted me to pay to return, both shipping and 20 % restocking fee. She reaffirmed that was correct. I gave her the example that I ordered a television set and what showed up was half of a toaster.

       "        <td>I am a joint owner on my parents account, they both recently died, XXXX and XXXX. I personally went to the Bank of America in XXXX, Texas XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX ) to ask what the status of the account was since my parents passed away. I was told since my name was on the account I could do whatever I wanted with the account and they would remove my parents names. I mailed copies of both death certificates to BOA as requested and then BOA sent me a new signature card to sign so only my name would be on the account, which they now have. In the meantime I was paying any bills that needed paying for my parents. During that XXXX month period I personally deposited {$1000.00} of my own money and my brother deposited {$5000.00} to the account to make sure there was money to cover any medical bills. I was told I was in control of this account or I would have handled the final expenses and deposits differently. Two months later on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I see that there is a hold on the account of {$1200.00} and {$2200.00} - I called on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and was told they were holding 50 % of the account for my Mom and 25 % for my date to cover any interest paid by the bank ( total interest paid in XXXX was {$0.00} ) so this makes no since to hold {$3500.00} for interest paid by the bank. I was also told on this call that the account was not set up with Right of Survivorship which up to this point I had not been told in person or on the phone. Also they have now tied my hands to pay any unforeseen bills that come in. All of my parents other assets were controlled by their trust but because we had the understanding that this account was under my control there was no need to include this account in the trust or probate their will. We were utilizing this account for end of life expenses. BOA is telling me the only option I have to get this money released is to Probate their will just for this checking account. BOA for two months gave me incorrect information in the Bank and on the phone because I also called and verified if I needed to do anything with this account or did I have control of it and was told YES. The bank should allow any surviving accountholder to continue to use the account to transact business after the death of another accountholder. We have an executed will and an executed trust that defines all asset distributions for my parents estate that should be sufficient to release these funds. I took all the right steps to notify BOA and now am being penalized because of BOA &#x27;s misinformation. It &#x27;s obvious if they sent me an new signature card ( in the mail ) they acknowledged I was entitled to control the account which confirms what I was told by BOA in person in the Bank in XXXX and on the phone. I have a copy of the original signature card from &quot; NationsBank &#x27;&#x27; from XXXX ( 20 years ago ) where the Accounts Names and Signature box for me to sign were prefilled by the bank. We had no idea we needed to mark any other boxes than what was prefilled by NationsBank ( now BOA ) 20 years ago. Current BOA forms make you initial that your are denying the Right of Survivorship.

XX/XX/XXXX, I received my transfer letter from XXXX stating everything I needed to know and that I should expect a welcome letter from Seterus shortly. Today is XXXX XXXX, 2015, and I have yet to receive my welcome letter, which reading the FTC website they must send me by XX/XX/XXXX. I called Seterus this evening and got the runaround, now keep in mind that I am new to them and they already are treating me this way. I &#x27;ve read a ridiculous amount of complaints about this loan servicing company, but now I &#x27;ve actually experienced it. I recorded the entire phone call, so that you can hear exactly what the representative, XXXX, said and how she dodged questions I asked. She just kept putting me on hold. I informed her that I was recorded the conversation and then it got a little hostile. She put me on hold again, where after a few more minutes of holding a gentleman that referred to himself as XXXX XXXX came on the line and began yelling at me about recording the call before he swiftly hung up on me. Now, can you explain how this kind of business behavior is acceptable? I got no information about my new loan, no information on how to make a mortgage payment, no loan number, absolutely nothing aside from vagueness and rudeness. These people have a duty to me the homeowner and they are not doing what they are supposed to do. Merely XXXX Seterus and you will see this is a SEVERE problem that nothing is being done about. This is my life, the lives of my children, my home, and I can not fathom that this kind of behavior would be acceptable by any standards. I have contacted XXXX, as they are the holder of my loan, to inform them of the problem. A woman by the name of XXXX informed me that XXXX is, indeed aware of these practices by Seterus and no action has been taken. Once again, I have this phone call recorded with her admission XXXX has been apprised of this issue. There have been over XXXX complaints to the XXXX, yet this company is still somehow allowed to continue their shady practices and downright fraudulent activity. The way they treated me was like my toddler putting his hands over his ears because he does n&#x27;t want to listen, Seterus does not want to listen to legitimate problems. I &#x27;m contacted absolutely every entity I possibly can to make everyone aware of this situation and compiling a journal of everything, emails, call logs, recordings, complaints filed, everything, and looking into contacting an attorney.

For the XXXX rent, she requested on XXXX XXXX, however as of today, XXXX XXXX the funds are still not available in her account. I verified that the funds were withdrawn from my non-Chase bank account on XXXX XXXX. I contacted Chase at the XXXX phone number found online. They told me that the transaction was accepted on XXXX XXXX after their cut off of XXXX Therefore the process would not start until the NEXT business day AFTER XXXX XXXX. Using this logic, the representative stated that XXXX XXXX was day XXXX, XXXX XXXX was day XXXX and today ( XXXX XXXX ) is only day XXXX. I was told the process &quot; can take up to 5 business days &#x27;&#x27; to have the funds available if from a non-Chase bank account. Then I was told that funds &quot;&quot; could be &#x27;&#x27; available either Thursday or Friday ( XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX ). I was not pleased with this confusing answer as I have not had this type of &quot;&quot; hold &#x27;&#x27; treatment on the other funds we have transferred. I believe this in an excessive amount of time to withhold funds on a recurring transaction that can been seen each month since XXXX. I think it is also deceptive to arbitrarily apply the holding of funds and not have a definitive timeline of when they will be available. I confirmed that the funds were withdrawn from my non-Chase bank account on XXXX XXXX and asked where they were. The representative stated whey were &quot;&quot; in process &#x27;&#x27;. Once again the timeline is not consistent with my other transactions. Please review this matter with Chase. I want to ensure other college age customers do n&#x27;t unnecessarily incur late fees ( for rent ) when Chase has chosen not to release funds that are valid and have cleared the sender &#x27;s account!
